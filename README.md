# Employee-Performance-Mapping
## SQL Project - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence T5
### As part of one of the projects in the T5 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp, we had an important project titled "Employee Performance Mapping." This project focused on creating and analyzing a database consisting of three main tables: Data Science Team, Projects, and Employees. The primary goal was to track employee performance across different projects and identify factors influencing performance improvement.

### To clarify the relationships between these tables, we drew an ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that illustrated how employees are connected to projects and their roles within the data science teams.

### Additionally, we used MySQL to answer a series of analytical questions through SQL code. These questions were designed to provide insights into employee performance.
